# Diamonds Price Prediction Project ðŸ’Ž

Welcome to the Diamonds Price Prediction Project!

This project aims to help diamond sellers determine prices based on the characteristics of a diamond, ensuring that the sale/purchase price is neither underpriced nor overpriced.

## Objective

To assist diamond sellers in accurately pricing diamonds based on their characteristics.

## Goals

Create a machine learning regression model to predict the price of diamonds.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be found on Kaggle: [Gemstone Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/soumyakushwaha/gemstone)

## Variables Explanation

- **id**: Unique identifier
- **carat**: Carat refers to the unique unit of weight measurement used exclusively to weigh gemstones and diamonds.
- **cut**: Quality of the diamond cut.
- **color**: Color of the diamond.
- **clarity**: Diamond clarity is a measure of the purity and rarity of the stone, graded by the visibility of these characteristics under 10-power magnification.
- **depth**: The depth of the diamond is its height (in millimeters) measured from the culet (bottom tip) to the table (top surface).
- **table**: A diamond's table is the facet which can be seen when the stone is viewed face up.
- **x**: Diamond X dimension (length).
- **y**: Diamond Y dimension (width).
- **z**: Diamond Z dimension (height).

## Target

- **price**: The predicted price of the diamond.

## Note

It's important to ensure that the dimensions of the diamond (X, Y, Z) are not zero, as it is physically impossible for a diamond to have a length, width, or height of zero.
